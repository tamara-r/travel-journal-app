# Travel Journal App

## Overview
The Travel Journal App allows users to document, organize, and share their travel experiences. Users can create journeys with photos, notes, AI-generated summaries, and geolocation while choosing between private or public visibility. The app includes a Home Feed for exploring shared journeys, a Profile section for managing trips, and a Map Integration for location tagging.

## Tech Stack
- Flutter
- Dart
- Firebase Authentication
- Cloud Firestore
- Firebase Storage
- Google Maps API
- Riverpod (State Management)
- OpenAI API (Optional)

Future considerations include trip planning tools, engagement features, and real-time updates for an enhanced user experience. The goal is to create a scalable and intuitive travel journal that blends personal documentation with social sharing.

### Standard Agile Story Points
Story points are used to estimate the effort required to complete a task. They are based on complexity, effort, and uncertainty. Below is the standard Agile story point matrix:

| **Story Point** | **Amount of Effort Required** | **Time Required** | **Task Complexity** | **Task Risk or Uncertainty** |
|---------------|----------------------------|------------------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| **1**         | Minimum effort              | A few minutes    | Little complexity | None                    |
| **2**         | Minimum effort              | A few hours      | Little complexity | None                    |
| **3**         | Mild effort                 | A day           | Low complexity    | Low                     |
| **5**         | Moderate effort             | A few days       | Medium complexity | Moderate                |
| **8**         | Severe effort               | A week          | Medium complexity | Moderate                |
| **13**        | Maximum effort              | A month         | High complexity   | High                     |
